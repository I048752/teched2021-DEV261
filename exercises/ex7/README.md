# Exercise 7 - BUILD AND DEPLOY CAP SERVICE

## Goal ðŸŽ¯

The goal of this excercise is to deploy the CAP service to the Kyma runtime. This comprises three parts:

- A [*deployment*](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) of the CAP service as a pod in Kyma
- A [*service*](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) to expose the CAP service as a network service  
- An [*API rule*](https://kyma-project.io/docs/kyma/latest/05-technical-reference/00-custom-resources/apix-01-apirule) that exposes the CAP service endpoints to the internet

When exposing the CAP service we want to achieve that:

- The metadata of the service is accessible to all
- The **orders** entities should require the application's **User** scope due to the definition of **srv/orders-service.cds**. This requires the use of the Destination service to provide a TokenExchange.

The deplyoment is declaratively defined in the **deployment.yaml** file.  

## Docker Setup

To achive this we first need to make sure that the Docker image that we will build is deployed to the right registry:

- Open the file **/deployers/service/Dockerfile** and replace **{your-docker-account}** with your Docker account id
- Save the changes

Now we have three options to trigger the deployment of the service that we outline in the next sections.

## Exercise 7.1 - DEPLOYMENT OPTION 1 - SAP CICD

In order to trigger the deployment via the SAP CICD service execute the following steps:

- Open the file **/deployers/db/helm/cap-orders-service/values.yaml** and replace **{your-docker-account}** with your Docker account id
- Save the changes
- Commit the changes to your GitHub repository

## Exercise 7.2 - DEPLOYMENT OPTION 2 - kubectl

In order to trigger the deployment via kubectl execute the following steps:

- Open the file **/deployers/service/deployment.yaml**  and replace the value of **{your-docker-account}** with your Docker account id
- Save the changes
- Build and push the Docker container of your CAP service via

  ```shell
  docker build -t {your-docker-account}/cap-orders-service -f ./deployers/service/Dockerfile .

  docker push {your-docker-account}/cap-orders-service
  ```

- Apply the **deployment.yaml** file via kubectl. This generates the *deployment*, the *service* and the *API Rule* in one go.

  ```shell
  kubectl -n cap apply -f ./deployers/service/deployment.yaml
  ```

## Exercise 7.3 - DEPLOYMENT OPTION 3 - Helm

In order to trigger the deployment via [Helm](https://helm.sh/) execute the following steps:

- Open the file **/deployers/db/helm/cap-orders-service/values.yaml** and replace **{your-docker-account}** with your Docker account id
- Save the changes
- Install the Helm chart via

  ```shell
  helm install cap-orders-service ./deployers/db/helm/cap-orders-service -n cap
  ```

## Result

The service will be accessible now via the url **https://cap-orders-service.\<cluster url>**. 

You can check also check settings of the API rule in the Kyma console. Navigate to the cap namespace. From there goto the `Discovery and Network -> API Rules` The rule has the name **cap-orders-service**

## Summary

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations - You've now successfully deployed the CAP service to Kyma and exposed it via an API rule.
