# Exercise 6 - DEPLOY HTML5 APP AND LAUNCHPAD CONFIG

## Goal ðŸŽ¯

In the step we will deploy the static HTML5 application to the **HTML5 Application** service of BTP. Depending on the previous setup choose the desired method for deployment. If the relating job was configured within the SAP CICD service then only the configuration of the helm chart is necessary, otherwise either the helm or the kubectl steps can be followed.

## Deployment of Service Instances

We will also deploy the BACKEND_DESTINATION to the service. This requires a few service instances to be generated which are defined within the file **service-instances.yaml**.

> âš  NOTE: The BACKEND_DESTINATION, **cap-orders-kyma-srv,** is configured to be defined as a subaccount destination and can be found within the subaccount under **Connectivity -> Destinations**. If any errors were made doing the deployment the destination can be modified directly. The property **SUBACCOUNT_LEVEL_DESTINATION** found within the **deploy-job.yaml** can be set to false to create instance destinations. The definition of the **BACKEND_DESTINATION** was configured in an earlier step and saved as **credentials/html5-config-secret.yaml**

To do the deployment execute the following steps:

- Open the file **/resources/html5/Dockerfile** and replace **{your-docker-account}** with your Docker account id
- Save the changes
- Create the service instances for the Destination and the HTML5 Application Repository services

  ```shell
  kubectl -n cap apply -f ./resources/html5/service-instances.yaml
  ```

## Exercise 6.1 - DEPLOYMENT OPTION 1 - CICD Service

- Open the file **/resources/html5/helm/orders-html5-deployer/values.yaml** and replace **{your-docker-account}** with your Docker account id
- Save the changes

## Exercise 6.2 - DEPLOYMENT OPTION 2 - kubectl

- Build and push the container to your docker account

  ```shell
  docker build -t {your-docker-account}/orders-html5-deployer -f ./resources/html5/Dockerfile .

  docker push {your-docker-account}/orders-html5-deployer
  ```

- Within the the file **/resources/html5/deploy-job.yaml** adjust the value of **{your-docker-account}**
- Apply the job

  ```shell
  kubectl -n cap replace --force -f ./resources/html5/deploy-job.yaml
  ```

## Exercise 6.3 - DEPLOYMENT OPTION 3 - Helm

- Build and push the container to your docker account

  ```shell
  docker build -t {your-docker-account}/orders-html5-deployer -f ./resources/html5/Dockerfile .

  docker push {your-docker-account}/orders-html5-deployer
  ```

- Open the file **/resources/db/helm/orders-db-deployer/values.yaml** and replace **{your-docker-account}** with your Docker account id
- Save the changes
- Install the Helm chart

  ```shell
  helm install orders-html5-deployer ./resources/db/helm/orders-html5-deployer -n cap
  ```

## Summary

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations - You've now deployed the HTML5 app and thge launchpad configuration.
