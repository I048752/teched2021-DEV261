# Exercise 3 - CONFIGURE THE SAP CICD SERVICE

SAP Continuous Integration and Delivery (SAP CICD) lets you configure and run predefined continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines that automatically test, build, and deploy your code changes to speed up your development and delivery cycles. SAP CICD supports a number of different use cases including the creation of pipelines used for the development of container-based applications. This exercise will provide the necessary steps to configure and utlize a container-based applications pipeline which will deploy the CAP application into the Kyma runtime.

## Open the SAP CICD service

- Within subaccount choose **Instances and Subscriptions**
- Under Applications choose **Continuous Integration & Delivery**

## Exercise 3.1 - CREATE THE GITHUB CREDENTIAL

This process will only be required if your GitHub repo is not public. The process will include the creation of a **Personal access token** which is used as a credential to pull the code from your repo.

- Within your Forked repository at the top right choose **your avator -> Settings**
- Choose **Developer settings**
- Choose **Personal access tokens**
- Choose **Generate new token**
- Provide the name **sapcicd**
- Choose the repo scope together with its subscopes
- Choose Generate token
- Copy the token value which is only shown once
- Open the SAP CICD service and choose the option **Credentials**
- Choose the plus sign to add an entry
- Provide the name **gitcred**
- Change the type to **Basic Authentication**
- Provide your git username as **Username**
- Provide the personal access token as the **Password**
- Choose **Create**

## Exercise 3.2 - CREATE THE DOCKER CREDENTIAL

The SAP CICD service will publish a new container image each time a job is triggered. This process requires access via an access token to a container repository, in this case Docker, to push the newly built container image to the repository, This step details the process of the creation of the access token used to perform this process.

- Log into your [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) account
- On the right hand top choose **your username -> Account Settings**
- Choose **Security -> New Access Token**
- Create a token with full access
- Copy the value into the json below replacing `{token}`
- Replace the `{docker-id}`

  ```json
  {
    "auths": {
      "https://index.docker.io/v1/": {
        "username": "{docker-id}",
        "password": "{token}"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

- Open the SAP CICD service and choose the option **Credentials**
- Choose the plus sign to add an entry
- Provide the name **dockercred**
- Change the type to **Secret Text**
- Copy the JSON structure as the **Secret**
- Choose **Create**

## Exercise 3.3 - CONFIGURE KUBECONFIG

To apply the configurations to the Kyma cluster we will need to authenticate to the Kyma cluster using a kubeconfig. A kubeconfig can be generated using a normal user which has an expiration time or a service account which does not. A service account is configured based on the APIs and their associated verbs available within the Kyma cluster. This service account can then be used to provide a non expiring kubeconfig which will be used by the SAP CICD service to apply the updated container images and associated kubernetes resources.

- Create the service account by following the tutorial: [Create a Kyma service account](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/kyma-create-service-account.html)
- Open the SAP CICD service and choose the tab **Credentials**
- Choose the plus sign to add an entry
- Provide the name **kymacred**
- Change the type to **Secret Text**
- Copy the contents of the **tutorial-kubeconfig.yaml** into the value of the **Secret**
- Choose **Create**

## Exercise 3.4 - ADD THE GITHUB REPOSITORY

This step details the process of adding the github repository container the code used to build the container images. Make sure to use your forked repository as the source.

- Open the SAP CICD service and choose the tab **Repositories**
- Choose the plus sign to add an entry
- Provide the name **dev261**
- Provide the url to your forked repo as the **Clone URL**
- If you defined a credential for your repo add it as the **Credentials** value
- Leave the rest of the values with their defaults and choose **Add**
- Choose **Webhook Data**
- There will be a link on the dialog which will navigate to **Settings -> Hooks** of the desigated repo
- Choose **Add webhook**
- Copy the values and adjust the **Content type**
- Choose **Add webhook**

## Exercise 3.5 - CREATE THE CICD JOBS

In this step we will configure the jobs to build each piece of the application. The SAP CICD service support the use of kubectl as well as helm. In the example we will configure jobs using helm. Add a Job for each microservice.

> The SAP Trial and Free tier are limited to two job configurations and one parallel build. For the exercise the creation of the job `cap-orders-service` is mandatory. The kubectl or helm commands can be used to deploy the other resources.
